To replace wordpress gallery with reel you need to add reel="1" to gallery shortcode. You can also use other shortcode parameters to set JQuery Reel parameters (for parameters description see [http://jquery.vostrel.cz/reel#syntax](http://jquery.vostrel.cz/reel#syntax)) You can also use Media options to replace all galleries with reel gallery.

1. Options for WP Reel (found in Media options). You can choose to replace all wordpress media galleries on site and set default speed (0 means no animation without user interaction)
2. Options for single gallery. Reel="1" replaces gallery with reel gallery if above option was not chosen, other parameters conform to JQuery Reel parameters (see [http://jquery.vostrel.cz/reel#syntax](http://jquery.vostrel.cz/reel#syntax)
